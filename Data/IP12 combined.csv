You are getting a 6.1-inch OLED screen, the classic design of iPhone 4, super-fast A14 Bionic chipset, capable cameras, all-screen front, Face ID and long battery. What else you want in a phone?"

The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I   ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don   t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I   ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don   t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don   t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box."

I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I   m happy with the blue colour      not bad at all and not too flashy   Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it   s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won   t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don   t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won   t comes with the phone)

1609384598-59,https://www.91mobiles.com/Apple-iPhone+12-viewReview.html,"By DT,",5,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn   t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."

This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move. Let   s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw - Stunning design, smooth app flow, battery life is optimal (best in my usage) and the camera is just bringing the life to all the captures you make. I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It   s nearly not a week for me but I can boldly say,    The best switch one can make   . I know the price tag is always richer but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving."

I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here"

1609384598-9,https://www.91mobiles.com/Apple-iPhone+12-viewReview.html,"By moazzam sameer,",5,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily."

This was my first switch to an ios device and i am not disappointed. The build quality is amazing and the phone feels very light and premium in hand. Same like the classic iphone 5 look. Fast responsive touch, Oled display, dslr like camera, optimal battery life, smooth app flow..there is nothing to question about the quality and interface from apple. Everything is so well crafted. And if you are from ios ecosystem nothing will go wrong. The camera is just way too good, especially the night mode. Nothing beats 4k dolby vision hdr video recording. However a telephoto lens is missing in the non pro models and you get a digital zoom of only upto 5x. The Face ID is improved and now works even in complete darkness. Some minor cons - 
1) The non pro models attracts a lot of fingerprints on the back.
2) When switching from android to ios there are no official or say free ways of restoring your whatsapp chats.
3) No charging adapter or Earpods with this model.
**Buy apple 20w charging adapter to experience real fast charging!"

1608745301-94,https://www.techradar.com/sg/reviews/iphone-12,Gareth Beavis,4,"It’s easy to dismiss the iPhone 12 as just 'more of the same', especially when you consider the new and compact iPhone 12 mini is on its way. However, 5G networks are rapidly rolling out across the globe, and the MagSafe addition could prove groundbreaking – these things, combined with an improved design and screen, mean the iPhone 12 will become more useful the longer you own it. However, it’s more expensive than last year’s iPhone 11, and it doesn’t come with a charger in the box; yes, there are environmental benefits to this, but you may need to factor buying a new charger into the cost of your new iPhone on top of the higher price."

1608745711-95,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/apple-iphone-12-review-6989047/,Anuj Bhatia,5,"If you are looking to upgrade your existing phone and have a spare Rs 79,900 for a new smartphone, I won’t stop you from buying the iPhone 12. You are getting a 6.1-inch OLED screen, the classic design of iPhone 4, super-fast A14 Bionic chipset, capable cameras, all-screen front, Face ID and long battery. What else you want in a phone?"
,,Amazon Customer,4,"I like the phone so far, but it is annoying that the new Apple lightening charger that comes with it is USB-C on the other end rather than a USB like EVERYTHING else is🙄-just as a heads up to make sure you have a way to plug it in when you get it, or have an older lightening charger on hand."
,,Amazon Customer,4,"I have been using iPhones since I was in seventh grade, my first one was the black and space grey iPhone 5, and gradually through the years Apple has continued to upgrade and better the model. The iPhone 12 includes a ceramic shield that will protect the phone from falls and drops from a few feet, triple lens cameras on the back, improved front cameras, a six inch display, come in a asort of colors, etc.
 The main strengths for this iPhone are its popularity, large screen, and longer battery life. The iPhone is no doubt one of the most widely used and recognized phones out there to date. A lot of people will just get an iPhone despite the fact that other phones can be just as efficient for much less, but no one wants to feel like the one left out. As the years have passed technology has been advancing and becoming a bigger part of our lives so small screens and low battery life are of extreme inconvenience, but with the iPhone 12’s 6.1 inch screen and long lasting battery life there is no need to worry about it. The large screen makes the overall phone look much more appealing and slick while the long lasting battery life promises to be reliable for those that are constantly using their phones, which most are.
 The main weaknesses of the iPhone 12 include lack of accessories in the box, pricing, and battery usage. The iPhone 12 will be the first line of phones from Apple that will not include a charger or power brick in its box, the company says that they are doing this to be green and save any ‘unnecessary’ material or resources that it would have taken and people are upset by this as that con  joins up with the pricing weakness. Now with the iPhone 12 already making a sizeable dent to one’s finances, they are not also expected to buy their own cables and power boxes should they want or need any more, and along with that, this iPhone has brought the return of the MagSafe chargers which magnetically attach to the back of the phone and charge it faster and more efficiently, however it would cost the owner about $40.00 just to get the charger. One other feature that dulls out the hype for this phone would be the effects of usage of certain applications like 5G data and the cameras built in zoom features, for these features iw would drain the battery a bit faster and could bring the life of the battery from 10 hours down to 6 or 7.
 I will always be loyal to my iPhone as it has always been a great tool for me and never failed to assist me bothin work and entertainment, so I would say that the iPhone 12 would probably be a must have."
,,Edward M Kirkpatrick,5,I upgraded to this phone and am really pleased! I purchase a screen protector and a case for it for which I am pleased. I even bought a belt holster which helps. I didn’t want to put the phone in my pocket. The battery life is very good and the camera is much better on this phone! I do plan to keep this phone for some time! I was not interested in the air buds as they don’t fit my ears that well and I have other buds I liked much better. The quick recharge cord is super! This phone is a little smaller than the iphone 12 pro but that is fine! I would buy this again!
,,Natty Fullms,1,"The product came with continuous software issues. The product was not damaged, and like all Apple products was packaged quite well. With that said, after booting it up I ran into non-stop issues. Everything from getting into my Apple ID Account, to getting my information transferred over. I spent most of my first day on the phone with Apple Care. Aside from having that largest bezels, smallest battery (2,815mAh), slowest refresh rates (60Hz), and overpriced hardware, it looks nice and has a very fast processor! All things said, 5G is several years out and this phone is too.  For $800+ the Samsung S20FE or OnePlus 8 would be amazing alternatives.  Heck I would even buy the Pixel 5 over this. Apple please listen to your customer base.  They don't want 5G or even better cameras. YOU'RE APPLE! This phone should have the smallest bezels, the largest battery, at least 8GB or RAM and 120Hz screen refresh like everyone else in the industry has been had for a year! Then you can charge $800 without a charger... lol Come on now!"

,,Lizzylee,4,"I’m not sure what the negative reviews are about; granted I upgraded from an 8 to the 12 mini! I’m not a techie however the transition was easy; the phone works great / I can tell an improved difference with 5g; I was disappointed the necessary charger outlet box, which has upgraded, was not included (cable was included), hence the 4 stars (if there is new equipment I feel like Apple should have included it… I will eventually purchase the new charger because it is supposed to be a faster charging time which I would love ) however you can still use the old one so you’ll be fine. No AirPods however I didn’t expect any because they are a huge expense if sold separately. I’ve been using my phone for about a week and I love it… Another quality Apple product"
,,Anthony,4,"The biggest selling point of the new iPhone is 5G. Some backstory, I live in a fairly large suburban city near east of Los Angeles. Because of the population density, I've been looking for a phone that would offer good cellular internet. when away from WIFI. I'm on Tmobile network and around my area, I'm getting around 3 mbps down and 2 mbsp up, that is worse than LTE. When I traveled outside of the major metro areas, I actually had to change service to LTE to get any usable internet at all. Other than that, the iphone works like it should, I noticed it is a bit snappier than my previous XS Max, particularly when snapping to home and opening new applications. Night mode is also something else, very cool feature. One other surprising improvement is that my Earpods and bluetooth devices sound better than before, which may have been due to the new bluetooth technology? The new iPhone is also noticeably lighter than my previous XS Max which felt like a brick. Some other small improves includes a brighter display and dynamic contrast. The biggest cool feature I think they bought back is Magsafe. I can see the myriads of docks, car-mounts, photography gadgets, phone cases, wallets, chargers, stands, tripods, gaming controller, portable battery packs, etc. that can take advantage of the feature. Some negatives I've noticed is with the speakers, maybe it's having to do with weight saving but they don't sound as ""full"" as my previous XS Max. It certainly gets louder but I feel vocals sounds quite tinny compared to before. I'm also not a fan of the HUGE camera cut-out, which seems to have gotten even larger over the years. This is an exposed area most cases cannot protect and will almost certainly get scuffed up easily."

I don’t believe that crap first of all I bought this phone from apple and I dropped it by accident face first on my driveway it didn’t brake the phone is good over all second of all
The whole changing situation people are saying the
Charger is uncommon what the hell no it’s a usbc to lighting cable usbc Charging bricks are everywhere my point is before you make a comment about this phone have some common sense about apple products"
,,Ryan,3,iPhone is great but not really white. Is an off white with a pink hue. I sent mine back and got the blue.
,,Captez,1,First you don’t get AirPods Apple also doesn’t give you the transformer you get the cord on the right side with the Sim card supposed to be it’s filled in and it’s different color than the rest of the case for that much money $100 more than the iPhone 11 I felt I got ripped off so don’t waste your money I got stuck with the fall next year I will go for Samsung no more Apple ripping me off captez

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

I believe they've already confirmed the iPhone 13 will also have a notch when we've already seen developers in the android space roll out under-display cameras, flexible OLED panels, under display fingerprint scanners, folding, flipping and spinning displays with high refresh rates and 10-bit color support. 
 

 
Regardless of your feelings, if we're looking at the competition around at the same price, Apple's design for the new 12 range is outdated at conception. We shouldn't be seeing the biggest manufacturer and well-known tech company in the world lagging behind, but it happens, because you're cool with it happening and you'll keep buying it. Why change, eh?"
,,BMSmith,2,"Will, 19 Oct 2020Because they are trying to minimise the harm on the environment and be more carbon efficient. ... moreDon't be a tool - this has nothing to do with saving the environment. They're still giving you a lightning charging cable in the box - a propriety cable that's already been called out for significantly contributing to electronic waste by refusing to switch to entirely convert to USB C - that's USB C to Lightning.  So when your old charging cable goes - and it will go - you'll likely head out and buy a plug that is USB C - Lightning , especially if you want to take advantage of the advertised 20W fast charging. That's not even bringing headphones and adapters into the equation - adapters that haven't shipped with the iPhone, but in separate packaging, since the iPhone 7/8. 
 

 
Don't defend nonsense like this - you wouldn't defend it from Samsung, from Huawei, from Xiaomi.

I acquired it through AT&T, the carrier that has been providing us w/service for several years. The new iPhone 12 is just about everything the heavy Apple promotional advertising promised, although America is slow allowing the full 5G capabilities to be fully exploited (unlike China and other nations). That said, my only real beef with the new 12 is that I am one of those geeky users who insists that a SPECIFIC Apple iPhone 12 DEDICATED user manual be accessible for new users to download. As it is, there is no such critter that fulfills this need, so I had to engage in a slow and trial-by-error process of uncovering answers to my specific user questions on-line, as they pertain to the new phone. If one is patient and persistent, all the sought-for answers MAY be uncovered, but Apple should have prepared an entirely new DOWNLOADABLE user manual specifically for those who have previously used iPhones only up to and including the 8 series units.

The phone itself is elegant, extremely well designed and engineered, but even though relatively small in size, still not small enough to conveniently fit into a typical man's button-down shirt pocket. Until Apple reduces the size of its products even further, the new-gen Motorola razr folder, with its amazing (stunning, really) folding display screen still gets top awards for convenience and practicality. I realise I should have acquired a 12-Mini due to its slightly reduced size, but it's too late now.

On the whole, however, the new Apple iPhone 12 is an excellent product and fully (in my opinion) up to Apple's traditionally high standards of quality, design and engineering. With 256 Gigs, you're fully loaded for bear, although prices are still a tad on the high side! Hopefully, AT&T shall continue to fulfill its provider services in the same spirit!"

The new A14 chip makes light work of alternating between apps, camera and other functions of the phone, everything is so quick and the display is crisp and bright.

The camera quality is outstanding, as a keen photographer, it is difficult now to decipher what has been taken with a dedicated camera (in my case a Panasonic LUMIX) or with the iPhone itself. The dedicated camera just takes it on a whisker, as some of the iPhone pictures (on landscapes for example), can look slightly unnatural as the software post processes the picture to brighten the image and compensate for the small lens (in comparison to a dedicated camera)

I am really nitpicking here though and for everyday objects, people, buildings etc, the iPhone pictures are excellent, and low light compensation is actually better than on my LUMIX Micro 4/3.
This is not even the Pro model either, but I don't think anyone would be disappointed with the base 12 spec as it were.
It is expensive yes, but you are buying advanced technology and it really is a compact computer which happens to have a phone contained within it!

As for the the functions, typical Apple - it works flawlessly and battery life is superb. Then again I am not using it for games or using the phone heavily. All in all an excellent replacement for my old iPhone6!"

Coming from an iPhone XR it feels much lighter and more compact all round, although it has the same 6.1"" size screen.

Screen is really sharp with vibrant colours although not cartoonish.

Like the new design, easier to grip when not using a case.

Feels speedier when scrolling through web pages or social media.

Amazing sound quality!

My main reason for upgrading was to future proof with 5G when it becomes more widely available and for the camera.

Camera upgrade (which I use mainly for family pics and snaps when out and about) is brilliant - night mode feature is stunning, as is the portrait feature which you can now use on non people subjects. I took a pic of a vase of flowers in the 'natural light' setting and with the back ground blurred and just focusing in on one bloom, it had almost digital SLR camera quality levels!

Battery - after a week of use, I'd say it's not quite as good as the XR, but on an average day I still have 39% left after 22 hours of mixed use.

I highly recommend the iPhone 12 - go on treat yourself, you know you want too!"

I have had Android since the very beginning. More recently, I have had the HTC One, One X; Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Note9. I always said that it would take a lot to pull me from Android and/or Galaxy. I was planning on getting the Note20 Ultra, until I got a load of the new iPhone. I like the design of the flat, hard edges vs. the curved ones from previous iPhones. The size is a little bit smaller than I am used to, however where it lacks in size, the Retina Display makes up for it, which a sharper, crisper display. I am not a fan of manufacturers releasing so many versions of what is supposed to be their flagship model. Apple does it, and so does Samsung. So I went with the regular iPhone, as opposed to the mini, or the Pro and/or Pro Max. I don't have anything to compare it to, as terms of size. I wanted this version to do in terms of features, without having to sacrifice too much. I feel this accomplishes that, and it is a good balance. iOS is very intuitive and responsive. The App Store is clean and organized. I do miss being able to bill certain apps to my AT&T phone bill. With the App Store, you do have to pay for more. Apps I was using in the Play Store cost money, albeit to get rid of ads in most cases. I didn't like having to buy my own wall charger to go with the USB-C to Lightning that is included in the box. Many of the sales associates I spoke with said that by now, Apple expects everyone to have had some version of the iPhone in their life, which is why they chose not to include it. That, and it's more friendly to the environment. If you were on the fence about switching, or even have an iPhone now, but contemplating the upgrade, I say do it. My fiancée has an 8 Plus, and was very jealous when I brought the 12 home. With the Pro Max coming out in a matter of days, you can't go wrong. I would have preferred a larger screen, but I didn't need the extra camera. If there is one con, I would say because of either the size of my hand, or the hard edge of the screen, when I'm holding it, the bottom corner hurts my palm after a while. The sound is great, both with the built in stereo speakers, and with AirPods. The charge currently lasts me all day, where I was charging my Note9 twice a day. Overall, very pleased. "

Really, they didn’t give hardly anyone a reason to get the Pro model iPhone. And...that’s not a bad thing!

Instead, they made their regular 12 basically just as good as the Pro models. So I got the 12 to replace my 11 Pro and lowered my monthly payment in the process while getting the A14 chip and updated camera hardware! Win win!

While being a bit larger(really just taller) at 6.1”, the 12 is substantially lighter than my 11 Pro was. The glass back and aluminum body are VERY grippy! Which gives me confidence while holding it while I wait for my Dbrand skin to come in the mail.

The screen is the same as my 11 Pro was and some icons are a bit bigger due to the display size(not a bad thing). In fact, I’m actually finding it a bit easier to type on the 12 because the keyboard is a just bit more spaced thanks to the larger display. Colors are beautiful and accurate. Text is very sharp. The OLED panels on the iPhones that Apple calibrates are fantastic!

So far, I haven’t had a single hiccup from the A14. It’s noticeably faster than the A13 was in my 11 Pro by about 20% I’d say in normal use switching between apps and such. Operations feel smoother. It’s a pleasure to use! I’m not a mobile gamer but I expect top notch performance from this beast if I choose to. I’ve also noticed that so far, the A14 doesn’t seem to get noticeably warm like the A13 did. And being that the A14 is built on a 5nm process(which is NUTS for a mobile device), this chip will be rock solid for the next 3-4 years!

So far, now on my second day of use, battery seems great! I used the 12 almost all day yesterday and ended the day with over 30% left. I suspect I would’ve gotten over 7 hours screen time. And the phone is still calibrating with my use so I also suspect it’ll get better within a month or so. My 11 Pro regularly got 8-10 hours of screen depending on use.

The cameras on the 12 are noticeably better than the what I had on the 11 Pro. All of them(wide, ultra wide, and selfie) are more color accurate and VERY crisp, producing some EXCELLENT shots. I did lose the telephoto going from the 11 Pro to the 12, but I rarely used that camera anyway...(it wasn’t the greatest)

The aluminum build of the 12 feels VERY premium in the hands and the throwback design to the iPhone 4/5/s is definitely a nice and welcomed refresh. It’s definitely easier to pickup from a flat surface than my 11 Pro was... I felt I had to gorilla grip the 11 Pro every time I picked it up so it wouldn’t slip due to the rounded sides...

So far, reception on the 12 has been EXCELLENT and noticeably better than my 11 Pro was by a signal bar or two. Granted, it’s the weekend and I haven’t left home as I’m just relaxing from the long work week. But just at home, I’m noticing better reception. Which is nice.

So far overall, the 12 is a nice upgrade from my 11 Pro in overall speed, fluidity and camera performance. Personally, I just don’t see the point in getting the Pro models this year. The 6.1” display of the 12 is about my max screen size I’d go. If Apple made the 12 any larger, I would’ve skipped it... the 5.4” mini is probably super cool and really nice to hold, but a bit small for my taste and it would’ve been a downgrade from my 5.8” 11 Pro. It might make a nice Christmas gift for the fiancé though! And the monster 6.7” 12 Pro is just ridiculous to me despite the upgrades Apple made to the cameras to try to get people to buy it... the 12 is the absolute sweet spot in the lineup and I see Apple selling MILLIONS of them.

Oh, and a quick note... if you’re upset about the charger brick and headphones being removed from the 12 lineup this year. Seriously, get over it... almost everyone is wireless these days or has headphones laying around. I’d suggest getting the Gen 2 AirPods. You won’t regret that purchase. They’re great truly wireless headphones. As for the charger, most people these charge wirelessly... get with the times... a wireless charger can be had for about $30. And nearly everyone has a USB charging bricks laying around...

Anyway, if you pickup the 12, you won’t regret it. Great phone!"

I hated it. I missed phone calls, it wouldn't give me a decent notification of text messages, and everything I wanted to do required searching YouTube for instructions. ""Android will do everything Apple can."" That may be true, but it takes twice as long and is twice as hard to figure out. And you cannot just search YouTube for ""how to do x on an Android"" because different Android phones work differently. If you want an application in Android you have to remember to find the Play icon. (Play??) For an iPhone, apps are found at the Apps icon. After a year, I no longer hated the Android. I just didn't want to be around it any longer. The best analogy might be to an abusive spouse who has sobered up and stopped the abuse. Too little, too late.

My iPhone 12 arrived on October 23, as promised. The transfer from Android was easy. The iPhone is intuitive. It is easy to figure out how to do everything. It gives me wonderful banners informing me of what I've missed. The facial recognition works well. The screen is bright and clear. The camera is easy to use and takes good photos. It's not an SLR, but the camera is great for 98% of what I want to photograph. The phone processor is very fast, and WiFi and Bluetooth connections are fast and reliable.

I hesitated to replace a phone I had only had for a year, but after a week with the iPhone 12 I am truly glad to be back with iOS"

My cell coverage has improved enormously, to the point that im actually happy with phone and service. 5G is amazing and the 4G LTE is vastly improved. The phone overall is an iphone and nothing has really changed. I came from an old 7 and haven't really noticed much difference other than the obvious. With no phone subsidies i waited for a deal and have realized the best course with phones is wait as long as possible to upgrade and only do it if your phone is broke(like mine finally did) or new service because that is my biggest takeaway and best improvement is the cellular performance of the 12. Very please with phone but annoyed by apples annoying charger games. Now they only come with the charging cord and no its not a usb its a micro usb and nothing i have is compatible. it won't plug into any of your old apple plugs and it does't come with one. Its what is keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Trust me everyone will be annoyed by the cord"

I purchased this phone and after 3 weeks the phone died. On a call and got that dreaded blinking apple. Tried to restore, hard restart, all the usual tricks. None worked. I brought the phone back to Best Buy. The person in charge at the Cell Phone area informed me that I was passed the 14 day return policy and that they could not help me at all. I asked what my options were and he said I need to go to the Apple Store out in the mall. Frustrated, I left and went to the Apple store. They were very helpful, however, could not offer me service for 4 hours. I sat in my car, watched netflix because I live 45 min from the mall. Finally getting into the Apple store they very quickly replaced the phone for me. I was in and out of the store in less than 30 minutes. The tech support there asked why Best Buy would send me to the Apple Store when they are an approved Apple Repair Facility and could have easily replaced my phone under warranty. Needless to say that is a day in my life I will not get back and will be the last time I purchase an I-phone from the Manchester, NH Best Buy store or anything else for that matter. I have always had good service from Best Buy until this purchase. I am very disappointed that it was more important to the Cell Phone Department that they move me along so they could sell more phones rather than try to help me. Very disappointing. The second phone I got from the Apple Store is working great. Hoping in time I will be able to love it."

So you can't use it on older phone charging bricks. Apple says its to reduce waste in shipping - really it's just an excuse to get you to spend more money to buy a charger for the phone. For $900, you should be able to charge your device. Beyond that aggravation, the face recognition vs thumb print for unlocking the device works ok if you're in well lighted areas. In darker environment it does not work quickly/easily. Forget unlocking your phone (if your car play wants your phone unlocked) while driving. The phone otherwise works as well as previous versions.

Now everything is controlled by gestures that work correctly, maybe, 2 out of every 3 times. This phone is also riddled with ads forced on you by Apple and AT&T, which is pretty sickening. And AT&T forcibly changes your web bookmarks with no way to stop it--which, again, makes me trust them even less as a company (a feat!). I'm seriously considering returning this phone and switching carriers. Unless something drastically changes in the future, this is, at minimum, my last iPhone, and probably the last phone I use on the AT&T network. Why pay the Apple Tax if all you get is a phone that's just as messy, trashy, and buggy as cheaper, more powerful phones? I'm disappointed this is what Apple has become and what AT&T continues to lean into being."

The fit and finish is very nice. The screen quality is an improvement over the XR. However, there is a major flaw that is consistent with both phone models--they regularly drop calls. We have experienced 5-10 drops while being on a 15 minute call. This has NOTHING to do with signal quality because most calls are dropped when using WIFI calling. Furthermore, this did NOT happen when using the XR, 7, or 8. The issues are sporadic. Sometimes we go days with no issues and other days it happens frequently. This issue is widely known, but there is no fix. We are all on the latest iOS update and have restarted many times. Don't buy this phone until you see a resolution to this problem posted online or someone from Verizon can point you to an article where it states exactly how it was fixed. BUYER BEWARE!!"

The 12 is solidly the best iPhone that Apple has made and is a huge improvement over the XR and 11. Apple has finally brought back the adored square design like the 5s instead of the chunky feeling round edges of the XR and 11. The screen is miles ahead of the XR/11 as well. iOS14 brings a lot of welcome additions that gets iOS up to par with Android (the widget system is reminiscent of Windows Phone actually). My only real criticism is battery life has taken a hit compared to the XR and Touch ID would've been a welcome inclusion given the pandemic but this phone was likely planned and finalized well before covid-19 changed everything. Fully recommended if you are on a XS/XR or older.

This phone is so good, I would recommend passing on the 12 Pro and either save the money or jump to the 12 Po Max"

I've skipped the last couple upgrades due to high costs and I didn't feel the need to upgrade from iPhone 8 Plus just because there was a new version deployed, but I felt it was finally time to upgrade. I'm glad I did. I love the camera on the phone (better than the iPhone 8) and the battery life. My 8 didn't seem to hold the battery charge quite as well as this new one does. I also love the different colors for the body you can choose from. The blue is very pretty. The face recognition took me a little getting used to (I kept pressing on the bottom of the phone face, looking for the ""home"" button) and of course, it doesn't work with a mask, but that's what the passcode is for!

There is not much of a difference in the two models and I personally think that I could have waited, because my 11 was paid off in cash at the Apple store. I like the vivid blue color, smaller size and camera, but the camera in the 11 was just as good. The 5G does not seem very fast in my area and I don't know what the hype was all about. I am also very upset that Apple did not include a charger in the box, because as much as you pay for the phones, it should include the accessories. I don't really understand why Apple doesn't focus on enhancements such as graphics, battery life and operating system; every phone just about has a camera and can do the same thing, therefore, they should focus on what makes the phone function. I am basically like meh with the changes and don't think that it is worth upgrading if you have any of the 11 models; save your money and wait for major improvements."

I needed a new phone anyways so I went with the iphone 12. It was first of all a good deal. For some reason Samsung went with what they call a ''C'' connector for the charging port and the 2 phones I had with them was nothing but a hassle. Apple connector is a male and the port is a female connection. And it stays tight where the Samsung phones female to the port which is male. The problem is the male end wears out after awhile and the you lose the connection to where will not not charge anymore and its replacement time.I haven't had any issue with the iphone 12 as of yet.

Why would they ever release a slower model than those released previously? This is the fastest iPhone yet, without question. And there’s no doubt that next year, they’ll release a faster model. With that being said, this phone is incredibly quick - faster and more responsive than my MacBook, which is both fast and responsive. Coupled with AT&T’s 5G network, I have never had a more satisfying experience with a phone in my life. There has been a lot of marketing hype regarding 5G, and I kept my expectations how. I wish I hadn’t, because this was a game changing experience for me. We often have buyer’s remorse when it comes to cell phones and cellular plans. iPhone 12, coupled with AT&T’s 5G network, will not be one of them."

I never had any issues with all the Samsung’s that were purchased. I only tried because I wanted to see what the Apple experience might be like. I will have to exchange and argue with Verizon about the brand new screen protector I put on the phone because it’s only 4 days old. Check out the picture and yes I made sure the lens was clean multiple times. I also took pictures of different walls. There was no light or something causing shadow behind me. Hope this is the only phone as I will exchange.

I admit it is taking me a while to get used to it as a former Samsung android user. Simple tasks like closing windows and turning the phone off are not intuitive (at least to me), but I am learning slowly. Connecting to my car via Bluetooth was easy, but had to look up information on how to get text messages connected. Biggest point of awareness is that a plug does not come with the charging cord, so for a newbie like me, it required an additional purchase. Luckily, there is a good user community that shares these things through reviews like this and other chats. So 4 stars - a bit of a bumpy start, but now that I've gotten things set up, I think I'll be very happy with my move to the iPhone."

After purchasing the phone also, it was not activated and I spent another 2 hours after coming back to home to get it activated. Another issue now is multiple contracts (3 contracts) are attached to my account whereas I have only one device. Still I am working with sprint / t-mobile to get it corrected.

Going from the Max to the 12, the screen difference isn’t that far off. Now that the 12 has an OLED screen and not LCD its even better. It doesn’t feel massive or heavy like the Max. It’s more compact and lightweight, takes amazing photos especially night mode. As for 5G... ehh. It’s ok. It is somewhat faster than LTE. I’ve yet to experience 5G UW.

Positive outcomes from my upgrade include a much better camera, more storage, larger screen, and (in my opinion) a better lock button position. I know the last point is very subtle but it counts as an upgrade, to me."

By the way the color is more like reddish pink. This not on ATT since ATT doesnt make the phones. Pre-ordering this phone was great with the special promotion to existing customers. I traded in a XR to get this awesome 5G 12 phone. Return process could be better as ATT only provides a very flimsy bubble pack to return the phone. This is the first time i'm ever trading in a phone, but the older phones are not being given justice the way it's being returned."

I guess I’ll up the ante to get access to what will hopefully be the promised higher speed. As I type this review I have loud static in my right hearing aid. It appears consistently on some apps, when I get most notifications, and when I’m on most voice calls. It appears in both hearing aids, but never both at the same time. Based on what I’ve seen on hearing aid blogs, it’s affecting many different brands of hearing aids. This suggests it’s an iOS problem. Hopefully Apple fixes this soon."

This is my second iPhone after the XR. What drew me to the 12 was the OLED screen, already great cameras from seeing reviews, blue color, 5g and how lightweight the phone is! I decided the extra camera and stainless steel frame weren’t enough to get me to a Pro. This phone is much easier to hold versus my previous XR with its lighter body and smaller frame but keeping the same size screen!

If you have any iPhone from 2017 or earlier, it will be easy to see why the upgrades are great (design, photo/video quality). While 5G speeds are mostly irrelevant in 2020, even LTE speeds show a decent improvement in the iPhone 12. If you are thinking about getting this versus the 12 Pro, save your money and get the 12. The better build on the 12 Pro isn't noticeable with a case on, the extra 2GB RAM shouldn't be important to most people, and that 2X camera might have been worth it if it was as good as the primary camera."

No qualms there. I am also not sure when the trade in packets will arrive, its been a week now and we should have had them in by now.

The only thing that maybe of concern especially to new users of Apple I-phone is that you no longer get a mains adapter however a USB cable is supplied .
I personally feel that Apple can do more to reduce the price of these phones and put them in reach of more people as I'm sure the profit margin is huge on these and now do not even come with a power supply. "

Very fast at everything seems quicker than my iPad Pro 3rd gen
Very clear display
Sits well in pocket
Amazing dynamic range of pics
Display - black are totally black
Buttons are good but still prefer sleep button to be on top
5g is very quick and is a bit of future proof
Charges very quickly with 20w iPad Pro charger

Cons
Not easy to pick up
Slippery in hand
Would prefer a slightly wider screen
Either sits on camera lens or screen when laying down, so case a must
Slightly unnatural look to images
Should have come with a power adapter
